# safe_graph_data_COVID19
Work documenting and processing data provided by Safe Graph

This repo will have items documenting the data and R code I use for processing the data.

The data is provided by [Safe Graph](www.safegraph.com)  as part of their efforts to help researchers work on issue related to the COVID-19 outbreak. They are providing historical pattern data for people's movement and foot traffic, which is their main business.
